# All files and subdirectories placed here will be copies to the image's ${STREAMSETS_LIBRARIES_EXTRA_DIR} directory
# Files should be placed in appropriate stage lib subdirectories.  For example
# to add a JDBC driver like ojdbc8.jar to the JDBC stage lib, the local file 
# should be at $PROJECT_ROOT/sdc-extras/streamsets-datacollector-jdbc-lib/lib/ojdbc8.jar
